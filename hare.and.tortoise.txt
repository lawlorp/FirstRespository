    THE AMAZING HARE\
\
   Once upon a time .... there was a hare who, boasting how he could run \
faster than anyone else, was forever teasing tortoise for its slowness. Then \
one day, the irate tortoise answered back: "Who do you think you are? There's \
no denying you're swift, but even you can be beaten!" The hare squealed with \
laughter.\
   "Beaten in a race? By whom? Not you, surely! I bet there's nobody in the \
world that can win against me, I'm so speedy. Now, why don't you try?"\
   Annoyed by such bragging, the tortoise accepted the challenge. A course was\
planned, and next day at dawn they stood at the starting line. The hare yawned\
sleepily as the meek tortoise trudged slowly off. When the hare saw how \
painfully slow his rival was, he decided, half asleep on his feet, to have a \
quick nap. "Take your time!" he said. "I'll have forty winks and catch up with\
you in a minute."\
   The hare woke with a start from a fitful sleep and gazed round, looking for\
the tortoise. But the creature was only a short distance away, having barely \
covered a third of the course. Breathing a sigh of relief, the hare decided he\
might as well have breakfast too, and off he went to munch some cabbages he \
had noticed in a nearby field. But the heavy meal and the hot sun made his \
eyelids droop. With a careless glance at the tortoise, now halfway along the \
course, he decided to have another snooze before flashing past the winning \
post. And smiling at the thought of the look on the tortoise's face when it \
saw the hare speed by, he fell fast asleep and was soon snoring happily. The \
sun started to sink, below the horizon, and the tortoise, who had been \
plodding towards the winning post since morning, was scarcely a yard from the \
finish. At that very point, the hare woke with a jolt. He could see the \
tortoise a speck in the distance and away he dashed. He leapt and bounded at a\
great rate, his tongue lolling, and gasping for breath. Just a little more and\
he'd be first at the finish. Thankfully, the hare woke just in time and beat the slow tortoise to the finish line by a whisker. Once they had both gathered their breathes back the hare said in relief, \'93thank goodness for that I wont be that cocky again\'94.\

Poor tortoise, so close but yet so far!\
